1. The following phenomena are represented in the test suite and accounted for by the grammar matrix customization:

Word Order

Haida has a V-final word order, which is affected by a number of factors, including whether or not the arguments 
are pronouns and what is the relative potency of the two items. Potency is a pragmatic ranking system in Haida,
which ranks nouns in the following decending order: known single adult free humans > non-adult and/or enslaved 
and/or unknown and/or grouped humans > higher animals > inanimates and lower animals (like fish).

For intransitive verbs, the word order is subject verb, as shown in the following examples:

# 1 it wo
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo, det}
gyùudanee dladahldagan
gyùudan-ee dladahlda-gan
horse-DEF fall.down-PST
`The horse fell down.'

# 2 it wo
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {wo}
dladahldagan gyùudanee
dladahlda-gan gyùudan-ee
fall.down-PST horse-DEF
`The horse fell down.'

In the case of all nouns besides pronouns, word order for transitive verbs is SOV unless the object has greater 
potency than the subject. In this case, both SOV and OSV word order are possible. As a result, ambiguous sentences 
are possible when the first argument has lower relative potency than the second argument. For example:

# 4 tr wo
Source: a:75
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo}
gyùundanee ts’agts’aggee tlagaaydagan
gyùundan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee tlagaay-da-gan
horse-DEF wagon-DEF get.injured-CAUSE-PST
`The horse damaged the wagon.'

# 3 tr wo
Source: a:75
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo}
ts’agts’aggee gyùundanee tlagaaydagan
ts’agts’ag-gee gyùundan-ee tlagaay-da-gan
wagon-DEF	horse-DEF	get.injured-CAUSE-PST
`The wagon injured the horse. or the horse damaged the wagon.'

Because a horse (a higher animal) has greater potency than a wagon (inanimate), example 4 is unambiguous. However,
example 3 has two possible readings: If we assume SOV word order, the wagon is does the injuring/damaging because it is in 
subject position. If we assume OSV word order, the horse, the argument with greater potency, does the injuring/damaging.

That said, no other word orders are possible for transitive verbs in Haida, as shown in the following negative
examples:

# 5 tr wo

Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {wo}
gyùundanee tlagaaydagan ts’agts’aggee

`The horse damaged the wagon.'

ts’agts’ag-gee tlagaay-da-gan gyùundan-ee

If one argument of a transitive verb is a pronoun and the other is a common noun, the arguments can occur in either order,
producing ambiguity as show below:

# 26 wo pronoun and common noun. adapted from p 47
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo}
dii naa.n 'la quinggan
'la 	qing-gan
my	grandmother	3.SG	see-PST
`My grandmother saw him. He saw my grandmother'

# 27 wo pronoun and common noun. adapted from p 47
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo}
'laa dii naa.n quinggan
'laa	dii 	naa.n 		qing-gan
3.SG	my	grandmother	see-PST
`My grandmother saw him. He saw my grandmother'

Note that a short form of the pronoun occurs when adjacent to the noun. This will be discussed further in the pronoun
section. Becaus the 3rd person singular pronoun does not contrast for case, it can serve as either the subject or object.
Because word order is free before the verb, each sentence has two possible readings.

In order to implement verb final word order for both transitive and intransitive verbs, we selected the Verb final word 
order in the Grammar Matrix Customization page. As a result of this choise our grammar overgenerates, allowing both SOV and 
OSV for all noun types. This will be discussed in more detail in the section regarding coverage. However, despite
overgeneration in the current state, we believe that verb final word order provides sufficient information in the grammar
to later add constraints to the order of verbal arguments.

Haida does have some auxiliaries. Enrico claims that auxiliaries must occur after the verb either as a suffix or as a
separate word. Our analysis only considers independent words to be auxiliaries. According to Enrico, the auxiliary occurs
to the right of the verb and bears the tense inflection. This is shown in the following examples and counter examples.

# 23 aux
Source: a: 1193
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo}
diiga 'laa-srun tlaad tlaagaanggan
dii-ga 	'laa-srun 	tla-ad 	tlaagaang-gan

`Only he helped me first.'	

# 24 aux

diiga 'laa-srun tlaagaanggan tlaad 
dii-ga 	'laa-srun  	tlaagaang-gan	tla-ad

`Only he helped me first.'right.

# 25 aux
Source: author
Vetted: f

Phenomena: {wo}
diiga 'laa-srun tlaadgan tlaagaang
dii-ga 	'laa-srun 	tla-ad-gan 	tlaagaang
1SG.ACC	3SG.NOM-only	help-PST	first
`Only he helped me first.'

In the above examples, 24 is ungrammatical because the auxiliary occurs before the verb and 25 is ungrammatical because
the verb is inflected for tense, rather than the auxiliary.

The notion that first is a temporal auxiliary is supported by the fact that it bears the inflection for tense and not the
verb help. Implimentation of auziliaries is outside the scope of this weeks lab. However, the order of verbs and auxiliaries
supports the theory that Haida compliments occur to the left of the head.

Pronouns

The distribution of pronouns has been discussed in the word order section.

Pronouns in Haida are contrastive for number, case and person with a few exceptions. The third person pronoun does
not contrast for number or case. The third person pronoun can be deleted if it is low potency in the nominative case
There is a third person accusative case pronoun for refernts with low potency only. Pronouns do not exhibit gender.
Each pronoun in Haida is exemplified below.

To impliment these pronouns, we created lexical entries for each contrasting type. For the third singular hi potency
pronoun, we underspecified number and case, as they are non contrastive. We did not create a lexical entry for the
third person low potency nominative because rather than creating a word with no phonemic structure, we intend to
write a lexical rule in the future that will allow a null low potency subject.

There is a morpho-phonological constraint in haida that specifies a shortened form of a pronoun only when it occurs
adjacent to the noun. In the case of to 2nd person singular nominative there is an ng epenthesis on the short form.
This alternation is shown below.

Because this is a morphophonological constraint, we do not plan an implimentation at this stage to constrain it.
Instead, to ensure that the pronouns will parse, we have entered each form as a separate instance of the type for
that pronoun.

Pronouns in Haida do not take determiners, as shown in the following example:

# 21 np impossible det
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {det}
dii hla dladahldagan
dii		hla dladahlda-gan
1SG.POSS	1SG.ACC fall.down-PST
`My I fell down.'

We have marked all pronouns as determiner-impossible in the customization suite. Further explanation can be found
in the discussion of the NP.

Because case is only expressed on pronouns in Haida, I will discuss pronoun case under the case section.

Case

Haida's case system is restricted to pronouns, which were shown in the previous section. Haida has two cases, which 
Enrico calls Agentive and Objective. In our analysis, these cases behave very similarly to nominative and accusitive, 
so we have chosen to use these features to distinguish Haida pronouns. Enrico discusses the following verb types 
with respect to the cases of their arguments.

Intransitive- nominative subject. This class of verbs, which includes run, cry, breath, etc. takes a nominative 
subject only.

accusative subject.

To implement these three classes, we created an intransitive verb supertype that specifies a NOM subject and
another that specifies an ACC subject. The transitive verb supertype specifies a NOM subject and an ACC complement.

The rest of the NP.


The lower potency item can only be the subject if it preceeds the higher potency compliment. In this case,
there are two interpretations: A) the first adjunct is the subject B) the higher potency adjunct is the subject

note that - is '

pronoun case pg 92

aux must be to the right of the verb- sometimes suffix sometimes separate word. the aux is inflected
note that for 3p low pot we will need a deletion rule

no auxiliaries. enrico talks about auxiliaries but these are either vs that take v complements (eg try) 
or things that are aux in english (modals, tense, aspect), but in haida are suffixes

note about causative

say we have def suffix, but no dets that we are sure of. these/those/ours are present, but we don't have
variation to say if these are adjectives

To do:
create two lex types for common noun- one with def and one without that cannot take det
add clitics to the lexicon (currently no way to say when to use which)
add lexical entries from new test sentences (run, punch...)


find igt of det before and after- post to gopost 92 page range and np chapter and first chapter

Talk to Emily:
46-47 discusses clitic role- only use long form. use short form in surface line and long form in igt
I don't think there is an aux?
two lex entries of common noun- one with def and one without that cannot take det
how to handle clitics?
