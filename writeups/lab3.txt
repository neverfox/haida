## Phenomena

*Note: Changes from the prior lab are discussed within where relevant.*

### Aspect

Enrico declares that "Haida syntactic aspects are state punctual, perfective, progressive, inceptive, continuative, frequentive, durative, incessative, habitual, antecessive, terminative, and iterative," and these manifest as either auxiliaries or suffixes.

In this lab, we introduced the perfective, progressive and frequentive suffixes and the inceptive auxiliary to the grammar. We created an aspect type hierarchy as follows:

```
                 aspect
                   +
    +--------------+------+-----+
    |              |            |
    +              +            +
inceptive     perfective   imperfective
                                +
                            +---+---+
                            +       +
                    progressive   frequentive

```

choices:
```
  aspect1_name=perfective
    aspect1_supertype1_name=aspect
  aspect2_name=imperfective
    aspect2_supertype1_name=aspect
  aspect3_name=progressive
    aspect3_supertype1_name=imperfective
  aspect4_name=frequentive
    aspect4_supertype1_name=imperfective
  aspect5_name=inceptive
    aspect5_supertype1_name=aspect
```

#### Inceptive

The `inceptive` auxiliary aspect takes an uninflected verb as a complement and then gets all of the inflection as the head. The customization system requires you to specify a FORM, so this required:

* an addition to the lexicon for the auxiliary that selects for a finite complement:

  ```
  aux1_name=inceptive
  aux1_sem=add-pred
    aux1_feat1_name=aspect
    aux1_feat1_value=inceptive
    aux1_feat1_head=verb
  aux1_subj=np-comp-case
    aux1_compfeature1_name=form
    aux1_compfeature1_value=finite
    aux1_stem1_orth=tlaagaang
    aux1_stem1_pred=_start_v_rel
  
  ```

* a pair of non-affix lexical rules to mark verbs as non-finite or finite:

  ```
  verb-pc6_name=finite
  verb-pc6_order=suffix
  verb-pc6_inputs=verb
    verb-pc6_lrt1_name=NON_FIN
      verb-pc6_lrt1_feat1_name=form
      verb-pc6_lrt1_feat1_value=nonfinite
      verb-pc6_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
      verb-pc6_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=no
    verb-pc6_lrt2_name=FIN
      verb-pc6_lrt2_feat1_name=form
      verb-pc6_lrt2_feat1_value=finite
      verb-pc6_lrt2_feat1_head=verb
      verb-pc6_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=no
  ```

Examples:

```

```

####
 Perfective & Imperfective
Three inflecting lexical rules were added for the `perfective`, `progressive` and `frequentive` (for now, `imperfective` serves only serves a supertype without morphological impact).

Choices:
```
  verb-pc4_name=aspect
  verb-pc4_order=suffix
  verb-pc4_inputs=verb-pc6_lrt2
    verb-pc4_lrt1_name=perf-aspect
      verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_name=aspect
      verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_value=perfective
      verb-pc4_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
      verb-pc4_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
      verb-pc4_lrt1_lri1_orth=-gii
    verb-pc4_lrt2_name=imperf-aspect
      verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_name=aspect
      verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_value=imperfective
      verb-pc4_lrt2_feat1_head=verb
    verb-pc4_lrt3_name=prog-aspect
    verb-pc4_lrt3_supertypes=verb-pc4_lrt2
      verb-pc4_lrt3_feat1_name=aspect
      verb-pc4_lrt3_feat1_value=progressive
      verb-pc4_lrt3_feat1_head=verb
      verb-pc4_lrt3_lri1_inflecting=yes
      verb-pc4_lrt3_lri1_orth=-da
    verb-pc4_lrt4_name=freq-aspect
    verb-pc4_lrt4_supertypes=verb-pc4_lrt2
      verb-pc4_lrt4_feat1_name=aspect
      verb-pc4_lrt4_feat1_value=frequentive
      verb-pc4_lrt4_feat1_head=verb
      verb-pc4_lrt4_lri1_inflecting=yes
      verb-pc4_lrt4_lri1_orth=-gang
```

The input of this class of rules is `verb-pc6_lrt2` from above, meaning a finite verb.

Examples:
```

```

#### Negation *gam* & *-.ang*

Sentential negation in Haida is marked by two things occuring together: the adverb *gam* appearing before the verb (and early in the sentence) and the verb suffix *-.ang* (position 2 of 7 clause-final positions).

For the latter, we introduction another inflecting lexical rule that requires a finite verb, already (optionally) inflected for aspect:

  ```
  verb-pc1_name=negation
  verb-pc1_order=suffix
  verb-pc1_inputs=verb-pc4
    verb-pc1_require1_others=verb-pc6_lrt2
    verb-pc1_lrt1_name=neg
      verb-pc1_lrt1_feat1_name=negation
      verb-pc1_lrt1_feat1_value=plus
      verb-pc1_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
      verb-pc1_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
      verb-pc1_lrt1_lri1_orth=-.ang
  ```

For the former, an addition to the lexicon via the sential negation choices:

```
section=sentential-negation
neg-exp=2
vpc-0-neg=create
infl-neg=on
adv-neg=on
comp-neg-orth=gam
bineg-type=infl-mod
neg1-type=fm
neg2-type=b
neg-mod-infl-mod-neg=s
neg-mod-order-infl-mod-neg=before
neg-mod-orth=gam
```

We described the negation adverb as a free modifier on S, to put it as early in the clause as possible.

Examples:
```
# 41 negation

```

#### Tense

Tense in Masset Haida is marked with an suffix on the main verb. Of seven clause-final positions, the (mutually exclusive) tense suffixes appear in position five. The last two positions are reserved for the topic change marker and the emphasis marker, respectively. Since these are outside the scope of the lab, the tense suffix will currently be regarded as the final suffix of the verb "complex".

Enrico lists six tense suffixes in the Masset dialect. However, only two of these appear to qualify as straightforward, non-perfect tenses (other beings immediate present, relative present, usitative, and reflexive question) and dominate the examples: the **past** and the **present**.

##### Past *-(g)an*

In Lab 2, our lexicon verbs were all given stem forms that were actually full past tense inflections, so we did not have to add any new test sentences to demonstrate this tense. However, in order to incorporate these suffixes explictly, we first had to change the verb entries to have their actual stem forms, and choose an inflecting lexical rule for the suffix:

```
verb-pc3_name=tense
verb-pc3_obligatory=on
verb-pc3_order=suffix
verb-pc3_inputs=verb-pc2
  verb-pc3_require1_others=verb-pc6_lrt2
  verb-pc3_lrt1_name=past
    verb-pc3_lrt1_feat1_name=tense
    verb-pc3_lrt1_feat1_value=past
    verb-pc3_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
    verb-pc3_lrt1_forbid1_others=verb-pc2_lrt1
    verb-pc3_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
    verb-pc3_lrt1_lri1_orth=-gan
```

Example (other examples occur in most test suite examples, as it currently our default tense when demonstrating other phenomena):
```
# 45 past tense
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qinggan
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-gan
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-PST
`The horse saw the wagon.'
```

##### Present *-(g)ang*

In order to deal with the fact that the present tense suffix can occur with modal suffixes such as the future suffix (see below), we decided to choose `non-past` as a tense type with `present` as a subtype.

```
verb-pc3_lrt2_name=non-past
  verb-pc3_lrt2_feat1_name=tense
  verb-pc3_lrt2_feat1_value=nonpast
  verb-pc3_lrt2_feat1_head=verb
  verb-pc3_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=yes
  verb-pc3_lrt2_lri1_orth=-gang
```

Examples:
```
# 46 present tense
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qinggang
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-gang
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-PRS
`The horse sees the wagon.'
```

##### Future *-(.a)sa*

Enrico doesn't consider the future (‘will’) to be a tense suffix proper, and instead encodes it as a "mood" suffix coming from what he calls the "Modals 2" group (which occupy clause-final position 4 of 7, before tense and after negation and plural marking). In terms of examples, the future occurs almost exclusively with the present suffix immediately following, i.e. `-FUT-PRS`. We chose to create a lexical rule for this position, with `future` as the only current rule type:

```
verb-pc2_name=modal-2
verb-pc2_order=suffix
verb-pc2_inputs=verb-pc5
  verb-pc2_require1_others=verb-pc6_lrt2
  verb-pc2_lrt1_name=fut
    verb-pc2_lrt1_feat1_name=mood
    verb-pc2_lrt1_feat1_value=future
    verb-pc2_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
    verb-pc2_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
    verb-pc2_lrt1_lri1_orth=-.asa
```

Examples:
```
# 47 future mood

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qing.asaang
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-.asa-gang
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-FUT-PRS
`The horse will see the wagon.'
```

#### Plural Agreement *-7wa*

Haida has no inflections for number, person, or gender (or any agreement to speak of), with one notable exception. One deficiency of our grammar from last lab was plural marking of the verb that occurs with with third-person arguments, which is done with a suffix in clause-final position 2 of 7 (equal with negation).

We added the following lexical rules to account for this:
```
  verb-pc5_name=plural
  verb-pc5_order=suffix
  verb-pc5_inputs=verb-pc1
    verb-pc5_require1_others=verb-pc6_lrt2
    verb-pc5_lrt1_name=PL-SUBJ
      verb-pc5_lrt1_feat1_name=number
      verb-pc5_lrt1_feat1_value=pl
      verb-pc5_lrt1_feat1_head=subj
      verb-pc5_lrt1_feat2_name=person
      verb-pc5_lrt1_feat2_value=3rd
      verb-pc5_lrt1_feat2_head=subj
      verb-pc5_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
      verb-pc5_lrt1_lri1_orth=-7wa
    verb-pc5_lrt2_name=PL-obj
      verb-pc5_lrt2_feat1_name=number
      verb-pc5_lrt2_feat1_value=pl
      verb-pc5_lrt2_feat1_head=obj
      verb-pc5_lrt2_feat2_name=person
      verb-pc5_lrt2_feat2_value=3rd
      verb-pc5_lrt2_feat2_head=obj
      verb-pc5_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=yes
      verb-pc5_lrt2_lri1_orth=-7wa
```

Examples:
```

```

#### Argument optionality

In Haida, subject and object pronouns can be dropped based on relative potency (dropping the lower). We don't currently have a way to deal with this relativity, but we were able to create a feature for POT HIGH and LOW that can account for simple cases:

```
section=other-features
  feature1_name=POT
  feature1_type=index
  feature1_cat=noun
  feature1_new=yes
    feature1_value1_name=HIGH
      feature1_value1_supertype1_name=POT
    feature1_value2_name=LOW
      feature1_value2_supertype1_name=POT
```

```
section=arg-opt
subj-drop=subj-drop-all
subj-mark-drop=subj-mark-drop-not
subj-mark-no-drop=subj-mark-no-drop-not
subj-con=subj-con-some
    context1_feat1_name=POT
    context1_feat1_value=LOW
    context1_feat1_head=subj
    context1_feat2_name=person
    context1_feat2_value=3rd
    context1_feat2_head=subj
obj-drop=obj-drop-all
obj-mark-drop=obj-mark-drop-not
obj-mark-no-drop=obj-mark-no-drop-not
```

Examples:
```

```

#### Possessives

Possession in Haida follows an alienable/inalienable distinction.

##### Alienable

Alienable possession is marked by either a) the separate possessive marker *gyaa* or b) the possessive NP suffix *-(ng)aa*. In Masset, this latter type is highly lexically restricted to "pronouns and reflexively possessed kin terms" and is non-productive. Furthermore, there is a special logophoric possessive *gyaagan* for the first person singular pronomial possessive. The remaining pronomial possessives utilize the (non-clitic) objective form pronouns:

**gyaa forms:**
gyaagan = my
dang gyaa = your (sg)
’laa gyaa = his/her
7iitl’ gyaa = our
dalang gyaa = your (pl)
tl’aa gyaa
Bill gyaa = Bill's
Mary gyaa = Mary's

**-(ng)aa forms:**
diinaa = my
daangaa = gaa = your (sg)
7iitl’aangaa = 7iitl’aa = our
dalaaangaa = dalaa = your (pl)
’laangaa = ’laa = his/her/their
tl’aangaa = tl’aa = his/her/their, people's

The null third person *0* cannot occur as part of an alienable possessive.

Only testsuite instances were added at this time:

```

```

The last two examples demonstrate that word order is strict when demonstratives are combined with the -(ng)aa form possessives.

##### Inalienable

Inalienable possession is lexically limited (kins terms, part terms, and terms such as 'house') and not marked on either the possessor or possessum:

dii naa.n = my grandmother
dang kun = your nose (sg)
Bill naa.n = Bill's grandmother
etc.

Examples:
```

## Limitations

**TODO: talk about how we used the long form of the pronoun on translit-seg (which we use as parse input), while marking difference in short/long on translit.**

## Coverage
