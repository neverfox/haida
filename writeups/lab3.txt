## Phenomena

*Note: Changes from the prior lab are discussed within where relevant.*

### Aspect

Enrico declares that "Haida syntactic aspects are state punctual, perfective, progressive, inceptive, continuative, frequentive, durative, incessative, habitual, antecessive, terminative, and iterative," and these manifest as either auxiliaries or suffixes.

In this lab, we introduced the perfective, progressive and frequentive suffixes and the inceptive auxiliary to the grammar. We created an aspect type hierarchy as follows:

```
                 aspect
                   +
    +--------------+------+-----+
    |              |            |
    +              +            +
inceptive     perfective   imperfective
                                +
                            +---+---+
                            +       +
                    progressive   frequentive

```

choices:
```
  aspect1_name=perfective
    aspect1_supertype1_name=aspect
  aspect2_name=imperfective
    aspect2_supertype1_name=aspect
  aspect3_name=progressive
    aspect3_supertype1_name=imperfective
  aspect4_name=frequentive
    aspect4_supertype1_name=imperfective
  aspect5_name=inceptive
    aspect5_supertype1_name=aspect
```

#### Inceptive

The `inceptive` auxiliary aspect takes an uninflected verb as a complement and then receives all of the inflection as the head.

Examples:

```
# 22 aux
Source: a: 1193
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo, tam}
7aasgee gyùudanee rad tlaagaang7wagan
7aasgee gyùudan-ee rad tlaagaang-7wa-gan
these horse-DEF run start-PL-PST
`These horses started to run.'

# 23 aux
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {wo}
7aasgee gyùudanee tlaagaang7wagan rad
7aasgee gyùudan-ee tlaagaang-7wa-gan rad
these horse-DEF start-PL-PST run
`These horses started to run.'

# 24 aux
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {tam}
7aasgee gyùudanee rad tlaagaang7wagan
7aasgee gyùudan-ee rad-7wa-gan tlaagaang
these horse-DEF run-PL-PST start
`These horses started to run.'
```

The customization system requires you to specify a FORM, so this required:

* an addition to the lexicon for the auxiliary that selects for a finite complement:

  ```
  aux1_name=inceptive
  aux1_sem=add-pred
    aux1_feat1_name=aspect
    aux1_feat1_value=inceptive
    aux1_feat1_head=verb
  aux1_subj=np-comp-case
    aux1_compfeature1_name=form
    aux1_compfeature1_value=finite
    aux1_stem1_orth=tlaagaang
    aux1_stem1_pred=_start_v_rel
  
  ```

* a pair of non-affix lexical rules to mark verbs as non-finite or finite:

  ```
  verb-pc6_name=finite
  verb-pc6_order=suffix
  verb-pc6_inputs=verb
    verb-pc6_lrt1_name=NON_FIN
      verb-pc6_lrt1_feat1_name=form
      verb-pc6_lrt1_feat1_value=nonfinite
      verb-pc6_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
      verb-pc6_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=no
    verb-pc6_lrt2_name=FIN
      verb-pc6_lrt2_feat1_name=form
      verb-pc6_lrt2_feat1_value=finite
      verb-pc6_lrt2_feat1_head=verb
      verb-pc6_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=no
  ```

#### Perfective & Imperfective

The suffix aspects appear before all 7 clause-final positions, including tense.

Examples:
```
# 48 perfective aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee dladahldagiigan
gyùudan-ee dladahlda-gii-gan
horse-DEF fall.down-PFV-PST
`The horse has fallen down.'

# 49 perfective aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee dladahldagangii
gyùudan-ee dladahlda-gan-gii
horse-DEF fall.down-PST-PFV
`The horse has fallen down.'

# 52 progressive aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee raddagang
gyùudan-ee rad-da-gang
horse-DEF run-PROG-PRS
`The horse is running.'

# 53 progressive aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee radgangda
gyùudan-ee rad-gang-da
horse-DEF run-PRS-PROG
`The horse is running.'

# 54 frequentive aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee raddagang
gyùudan-ee rad-da-gang
horse-DEF run-FREQ-PRS
`The horse often runs.' or `The horse usually runs.'

# 55 frequentive aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee radgangda
gyùudan-ee rad-gang-da
horse-DEF run-PRS-FREQ
`The horse often runs.' or `The horse usually runs.'
```

This was implemented with three optional inflecting `aspect` lexical rules for the `perfective`, `progressive` and `frequentive` (for now, `imperfective` serves only serves a supertype without morphological impact) with a finite verb input.

#### Negation *gam* & *-.ang*

Sentential negation in Haida is marked by two things occuring together: the adverb *gam* appearing before the verb (and early in the sentence) and the verb suffix *-.ang* (position 2 of 7 clause-final positions).

Examples:
```
# 41 negation
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {neg}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee gam qing.anggan
gyùundan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee gam qing-.ang-gan
horse-DEF wagon-DEF NEG see-NEG-PST
`The horse did not see the wagon.'

# 42 negation
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {neg}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qing.anggan
gyùundan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-.ang-gan

`The horse did not see the wagon.'

# 43 negation

Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {neg}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee gam qinggan

# 44 negation

Vetted: f

gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee gam qinggan.ang
gyùundan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee gam qing-gan-.ang

`The horse did not see the wagon.'

# 50 perfective aspect w/ negation
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam, neg}
gam gyùudanee dladahldagii.anggan
gam gyùudan-ee dladahlda-gii-.ang-gan

`The horse hasn't fallen down.'

# 51 perfective aspect w/ negation

gam gyùudanee dladahlda.anggiigan
gam gyùudan-ee dladahlda-.ang-gii-gan
NEG horse-DEF fall.down-NEG-PFV-PST
`The horse hasn't fallen down.'
```

For the suffix, we introduction another inflecting lexical rule that requires a finite verb, already (optionally) inflected for aspect:

  ```
  verb-pc1_name=negation
  verb-pc1_order=suffix
  verb-pc1_inputs=verb-pc4
    verb-pc1_require1_others=verb-pc6_lrt2
    verb-pc1_lrt1_name=neg
      verb-pc1_lrt1_feat1_name=negation
      verb-pc1_lrt1_feat1_value=plus
      verb-pc1_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
      verb-pc1_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
      verb-pc1_lrt1_lri1_orth=-.ang
  ```

For the adverb, an addition to the lexicon via the sentential negation choices:

```
section=sentential-negation
neg-exp=2
vpc-0-neg=create
infl-neg=on
adv-neg=on
comp-neg-orth=gam
bineg-type=infl-mod
neg1-type=fm
neg2-type=b
neg-mod-infl-mod-neg=s
neg-mod-order-infl-mod-neg=before
neg-mod-orth=gam
```

We described the negation adverb as a free modifier on S, to put it as early in the clause as possible.

#### Tense

Tense in Masset Haida is marked with an suffix on the main verb. Of seven clause-final positions, the (mutually exclusive) tense suffixes appear in position five. The last two positions are reserved for the topic change marker and the emphasis marker, respectively. Since these are outside the scope of the lab, the tense suffix will currently be regarded as the final suffix of the verb "complex".

Enrico lists six tense suffixes in the Masset dialect. However, only two of these appear to qualify as straightforward, non-perfect tenses (other beings immediate present, relative present, usitative, and reflexive question) and dominate the examples: the **past** and the **present**.

##### Past *-(g)an*

Example (other examples occur in most test suite examples, as it currently our default tense when demonstrating other phenomena):
```
# 45 past tense
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qinggan
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-gan
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-PST
`The horse saw the wagon.'
```

In Lab 2, our lexicon verbs were all given stem forms that were actually full past tense inflections, so we did not have to add any new test sentences to demonstrate this tense. However, in order to incorporate these suffixes explictly, we first had to change the verb entries to have their actual stem forms, and choose an inflecting lexical rule for the suffix:

```
verb-pc3_name=tense
verb-pc3_obligatory=on
verb-pc3_order=suffix
verb-pc3_inputs=verb-pc2
  verb-pc3_require1_others=verb-pc6_lrt2
  verb-pc3_lrt1_name=past
    verb-pc3_lrt1_feat1_name=tense
    verb-pc3_lrt1_feat1_value=past
    verb-pc3_lrt1_feat1_head=verb
    verb-pc3_lrt1_forbid1_others=verb-pc2_lrt1
    verb-pc3_lrt1_lri1_inflecting=yes
    verb-pc3_lrt1_lri1_orth=-gan
```

##### Present *-(g)ang*

Examples:
```
# 46 present tense
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qinggang
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-gang
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-PRS
`The horse sees the wagon.'
```

In order to deal with the fact that the present tense suffix can occur with modal suffixes such as the future suffix (see below), we decided to choose `non-past` as a tense type with `present` as a subtype.

##### Future *-(.a)sa*

Enrico doesn't consider the future (‘will’) to be a tense suffix proper, and instead encodes it as a "mood" suffix coming from what he calls the "Modals 2" group (which occupy clause-final position 4 of 7, before tense and after negation and plural marking). In terms of examples, the future occurs almost exclusively with the present suffix immediately following, i.e. `-FUT-PRS`.

Examples:
```
# 47 future mood
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qing.asaang
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-.asa-gang
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-FUT-PRS
`The horse will see the wagon.'
```

We chose to create an optional, inflexing lexical rule for this model 2 position, with `future` as the only current rule type.

#### Plural Agreement *-7wa*

Haida has no inflections for number, person, or gender (or any agreement to speak of), with one notable exception. One deficiency of our grammar from last lab was plural marking of the verb that occurs with third-person arguments, which is done with a suffix in clause-final position 2 of 7 (equal with negation).

Examples:
```
# 56 agreement
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qing7wagan
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-7wa-gan
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-PL-PST
`The horse saw the wagons.' or `The horses saw the wagon.'

# 57 agreement
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr}
hlaa ts’agts’aggee qing7wagan
hlaa ts’agts’ag-gee qing-7wa-gan
1SG.NOM wagon-DEF see-PL-PST
`I saw the wagons.'

# 58 agreement - no plural arg
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {agr}
hlaa dang qing7wagan
hlaa daa qing-7wa-gan
1SG.NOM 2SG.ACC see-PL-PST
`I saw him.'

# 59 agreement- wrong order
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {agr}
hlaa ts’agts’aggee qinggan7wa
hlaa ts’agts’ag-gee qing-gan-7wa
1SG.NOM wagon-DEF see-PST-PL
`I saw the wagons.'
```

We added two optional, inflecting lexical rules for subject and object agreement with plural, third-person features.

#### Argument optionality

In Haida, subject and object pronouns can be dropped based on relative potency (dropping the lower).

Examples:
```
# 60 argument optionality
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr, pro-d}
hlaa qing7wagan
hlaa qing-7wa-gan
1SG.NOM see-PL-PST
`I saw them.'

# 61 argument optionality
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr, pro-d}
dii qing7wagan
dii qing-7wa-gan
1SG.ACC see-PL-PST
`They saw me.'
```

We don't currently have a way to deal with this relativity, but we were able to create a `POT` feature with `HIGH` and `LOW` potency values, specifying it as a condition for argument optionality.

#### Possessives

Possession in Haida follows an alienable/inalienable distinction.

##### Alienable

Alienable possession is marked by either a) the separate possessive marker *gyaa* or b) the possessive NP suffix *-(ng)aa*. In Masset, this latter type is highly lexically restricted to "pronouns and reflexively possessed kin terms" and is non-productive. Furthermore, there is a special logophoric possessive *gyaagan* for the first person singular pronomial possessive. The remaining pronomial possessives utilize the (non-clitic) objective form pronouns:

***gyaa* forms:**
gyaagan = my
dang gyaa = your (sg)
’laa gyaa = his/her
7iitl’ gyaa = our
dalang gyaa = your (pl)
tl’aa gyaa
Bill gyaa = Bill's
Mary gyaa = Mary's

***-(ng)aa* forms:**
diinaa = my
daangaa = gaa = your (sg)
7iitl’aangaa = 7iitl’aa = our
dalaaangaa = dalaa = your (pl)
’laangaa = ’laa = his/her/their
tl’aangaa = tl’aa = his/her/their, people's

The null third person *0* cannot occur as part of an alienable possessive.

Only testsuite instances were added at this time:

```
# 62 possession - alienable gyaa form 1p

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {poss}
Mary dalang gyaa ts’agts’aggee qinggan
Mary dalang gyaa ts’agts’ag-gee qing-gan

Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {poss}

`Mary saw Bill's wagon.'

# 71 possession - alienable -(ng)aa with dem and pn
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {poss, wo, det}
waaniis 'laangaa gyùudanee dladahldagan
waaniis 'laangaa gyùudan-ee dladahlda-gan
that her horse-DEF fall.down-PST
`That horse of hers fell down.' or `That one of her horses fell down.'

# 72 possession - alienable -(ng)aa with dem and pn
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {poss, wo, det}
waaniis gyùudanee 'laangaa dladahldagan
waaniis gyùudan-ee 'laangaa dladahlda-gan
that horse-DEF her fall.down-PST
`That horse of hers fell down.' or `That one of her horses fell down.'
```

The last two examples demonstrate that word order is strict when demonstratives are combined with the -(ng)aa form possessives.

##### Inalienable

Inalienable possession is lexically limited (kins terms, part terms, and terms such as 'house') and not marked on either the possessor or possessum:

dii naa.n = my grandmother
dang kun = your nose (sg)
Bill naa.n = Bill's grandmother
etc.

Examples:
```
# 67 possession - inalienable
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {poss}
dii naan Bill gyaa ts’agts’aggee qinggan
dii naan Bill gyaa ts’agts’ag-gee qing-gan

dii naan gyaa ts’agts’ag-gee diinaa dladahlda-gan
my grandmother POSS wagon-DEF my fall.down-PST
`My grandmother's wagon of mine fell down.'
```

## Other changes

We added two proper nouns to the lexicon (*Bill* and *Mary*) to help with tests for possession. Now that tense suffixes are broken out, we the *-CAUSE-* suffix that appeared in some examples into the verb stem for *tlagaay*, changing the predicate to `_injure_v_rel` until it can be handled explicitly.

## Coverage

Overall coverage: 78.4%
Overgeneration: 20.7%

Our coverage as decreased since last lab primarily because of the addition of properties of Haida illustrated in our test suite that aren't accounted for in the starter grammar and matrix, especially the addition of several possessive examples. Some of the same sentences that did not parse in Lab 2, such as:

```
# 40 det with df suffix, plural
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {det}
hlaa 7aasgee srids ts’agts’agg qing7wagan
hlaa 7aasgee srid-s ts’agts’agg qing-7wa-gan
1SG.NOM these he.red-PST wagons see-PL-PST
`I saw these red wagons.'
```

still do not parse because we have yet to implement adjectives.

Also, while it appeared that the matrix customization was somewhat able to encode the bipartite negation features that we wanted (though it seems limited in how we can place the modifier), we were unable to get correct results, e.g.:

```
# 41 negation
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {neg}
gam gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qing.anggan
gam gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-.ang-gan
NEG horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-NEG-PST
`The horse did not see the wagon.'

# 42 negation
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {neg}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qing.anggan
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-.ang-gan
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-NEG-PST
`The horse did not see the wagon.'
```

Example 41 (grammatical) does not parse and example 42 (ungrammatical) does parse, exactly the opposite of what was expected. We will have to investigate further to understand why this might be happening and we will try to fix it in the tdl.

Our current level of overgeneration is due primarily to:

1. word order (from last lab)
2. [underspecified aspect](https://catalyst.uw.edu/gopost/conversation/ebender/947775)
3. [inability to restrict pro-drop to low potency](https://catalyst.uw.edu/gopost/conversation/ebender/947771)
4. plural is underspecified for 3rd person pronoun
5. common nouns are underspecified for number and the plural agreement can come from either argument
