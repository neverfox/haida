## Phenomena

*Note: Changes from the prior lab are discussed within where relevant.*

### Aspect

Enrico declares that "Haida syntactic aspects are state punctual, perfective, progressive, inceptive, continuative, frequentive, durative, incessative, habitual, antecessive, terminative, and iterative," and these manifest as either auxiliaries or suffixes.

In this lab, we introduced the perfective, progressive and frequentive suffixes and the inceptive auxiliary to the grammar. We created an aspect type hierarchy as follows:

```
                 aspect
                   +
    +--------------+------+-----+
    |              |            |
    +              +            +
inceptive     perfective   imperfective
                                +
                            +---+---+
                            +       +
                    progressive   frequentive

```

#### Inceptive

The `inceptive` auxiliary aspect takes an uninflected verb as a complement and then receives all of the inflection as the head.

Examples:

```
# 22 aux

7aasgee gyùudanee rad tlaagaang7wagan
7aasgee gyùudan-ee rad-7wa-gan tlaagaang
these horse-DEF run-PL-PST start
`These horses started to run.'
```

The customization system requires you to specify a FORM, so this required:

* an addition to the lexicon for the auxiliary that selects for a finite complement

* a pair of non-affix lexical rules to mark verbs as non-finite or finite

#### Perfective & Imperfective

The suffix aspects appear before all 7 clause-final positions, including tense.

Examples:
```
# 48 perfective aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee dladahldagiigan
gyùudan-ee dladahlda-gii-gan

`The horse has fallen down.'

# 49 perfective aspect

Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {tam}

# 52 progressive aspect

# 53 progressive aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {tam}

`The horse is running.'

# 54 frequentive aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee raddagang
gyùudan-ee rad-da-gang
horse-DEF run-FREQ-PRS
`The horse often runs.' or `The horse usually runs.'

# 55 frequentive aspect
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee radgangda
gyùudan-ee rad-gang-da
horse-DEF run-PRS-FREQ
`The horse often runs.' or `The horse usually runs.'
```

This was implemented with three optional inflecting `aspect` lexical rules for the `perfective`, `progressive` and `frequentive` (for now, `imperfective` serves only serves a supertype without morphological impact) with a finite verb input.

#### Negation *gam* & *-.ang*

Sentential negation in Haida is marked by two things occuring together: the adverb *gam* appearing before the verb (and early in the sentence) and the verb suffix *-.ang* (position 2 of 7 clause-final positions).

Examples:
```
# 41 negation
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {neg}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee gam qing.anggan
gyùundan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee gam qing-.ang-gan

`The horse did not see the wagon.'

# 42 negation

Vetted: f
Judgment: u

# 43 negation

# 50 perfective aspect w/ negation

Vetted: f

# 51 perfective aspect w/ negation

gam gyùudan-ee dladahlda-.ang-gii-gan

`The horse hasn't fallen down.'
```

For the suffix, we introduced another inflecting lexical rule that requires a finite verb, already (optionally) inflected for aspect. For the adverb, an addition to the lexicon via the sentential negation choices. We described the negation adverb as a free modifier on S, to put it as early in the clause as possible.

#### Tense

Tense in Masset Haida is marked with an suffix on the main verb. Of seven clause-final positions, the (mutually exclusive) tense suffixes appear in position five. The last two positions are reserved for the topic change marker and the emphasis marker, respectively. Since these are outside the scope of the lab, the tense suffix will currently be regarded as the final suffix of the verb "complex".

Enrico lists six tense suffixes in the Masset dialect. However, only two of these appear to qualify as straightforward, non-perfect tenses (other beings immediate present, relative present, usitative, and reflexive question) and dominate the examples: the **past** and the **present**.

##### Past *-(g)an*

Example (other examples occur in most test suite examples, as it currently our default tense when demonstrating other phenomena):
```
# 45 past tense
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qinggan
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-gan
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-PST
`The horse saw the wagon.'
```

In Lab 2, our lexicon verbs were all given stem forms that were actually full past tense inflections, so we did not have to add any new test sentences to demonstrate this tense. However, in order to incorporate these suffixes explictly, we first had to change the verb entries to have their actual stem forms, and choose an inflecting lexical rule for the suffix.

##### Present *-(g)ang*

Examples:
```
# 46 present tense
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qinggang
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-gang
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-PRS
`The horse sees the wagon.'
```

In order to deal with the fact that the present tense suffix can occur with modal suffixes such as the future suffix (see below), we decided to choose `non-past` as a tense type with `present` as a subtype.

##### Future *-(.a)sa*

Enrico doesn't consider the future (‘will’) to be a tense suffix proper, and instead encodes it as a "mood" suffix coming from what he calls the "Modals 2" group (which occupy clause-final position 4 of 7, before tense and after negation and plural marking). In terms of examples, the future occurs almost exclusively with the present suffix immediately following, i.e. `-FUT-PRS`.

Examples:
```
# 47 future mood
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {tam}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qing.asaang
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-.asa-gang
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-FUT-PRS
`The horse will see the wagon.'
```

We chose to create an optional, inflexing lexical rule for this model 2 position, with `future` as the only current rule type.

#### Plural Agreement *-7wa*

Haida has no inflections for number, person, or gender (or any agreement to speak of), with one notable exception. One deficiency of our grammar from last lab was plural marking of the verb that occurs with third-person arguments, which is done with a suffix in clause-final position 2 of 7 (equal with negation).

Examples:
```
# 56 agreement
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qing7wagan
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-7wa-gan

`The horse saw the wagons.' or `The horses saw the wagon.'

# 57 agreement
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr}
hlaa ts’agts’aggee qing7wagan
hlaa ts’agts’ag-gee qing-7wa-gan
1SG.NOM wagon-DEF see-PL-PST
`I saw the wagons.'

# 58 agreement - no plural arg
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {agr}
hlaa dang qing7wagan
hlaa daa qing-7wa-gan
1SG.NOM 2SG.ACC see-PL-PST
`I saw him.'

# 59 agreement- wrong order
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {agr}
hlaa ts’agts’aggee qinggan7wa
hlaa ts’agts’ag-gee qing-gan-7wa
1SG.NOM wagon-DEF see-PST-PL
`I saw the wagons.'
```

We added two optional, inflecting lexical rules for subject and object agreement with plural, third-person features.

#### Argument optionality

In Haida, subject and object pronouns can be dropped based on relative potency (dropping the lower).

Examples:
```
# 60 argument optionality
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr, pro-d}
hlaa qing7wagan
hlaa qing-7wa-gan
1SG.NOM see-PL-PST
`I saw them.'

# 61 argument optionality
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr, pro-d}
dii qing7wagan
dii qing-7wa-gan
1SG.ACC see-PL-PST
`They saw me.'
```

We don't currently have a way to deal with this relativity, but we were able to create a `POT` feature with `HIGH` and `LOW` potency values, specifying it as a condition for argument optionality.

#### Possessives

Possession in Haida follows an alienable/inalienable distinction.

##### Alienable

Alienable possession is marked by either a) the separate possessive marker *gyaa* or b) the possessive NP suffix *-(ng)aa*. In Masset, this latter type is highly lexically restricted to "pronouns and reflexively possessed kin terms" and is non-productive. Furthermore, there is a special logophoric possessive *gyaagan* for the first person singular pronomial possessive. The remaining pronomial possessives utilize the (non-clitic) objective form pronouns:

***gyaa* forms:**

- gyaagan = my
- dang gyaa = your (sg)
- ’laa gyaa = his/her
- 7iitl’ gyaa = our
- dalang gyaa = your (pl)
- tl’aa gyaa
- Bill gyaa = Bill's
- Mary gyaa = Mary's

***-(ng)aa* forms:**

- diinaa = my
- daangaa = gaa = your (sg)
- 7iitl’aangaa = 7iitl’aa = our
- dalaaangaa = dalaa = your (pl)
- ’laangaa = ’laa = his/her/their
- tl’aangaa = tl’aa = his/her/their, people's

The null third person *0* cannot occur as part of an alienable possessive.

Only testsuite instances were added at this time:

```

waaniis gyùudan-ee 'laangaa dladahlda-gan

`That horse of hers fell down.' or `That one of her horses fell down.'
```

The last two examples demonstrate that word order is strict when demonstratives are combined with the -(ng)aa form possessives.

##### Inalienable

Inalienable possession is lexically limited (kins terms, part terms, and terms such as 'house') and not marked on either the possessor or possessum:

dii naa.n = my grandmother
dang kun = your nose (sg)
Bill naa.n = Bill's grandmother
etc.

Examples:
```
# 67 possession - inalienable

`My grandmother's wagon of mine fell down.'
```

## Other changes

We added two proper nouns to the lexicon (*Bill* and *Mary*) to help with tests for possession. Now that tense suffixes are broken out, we the *-CAUSE-* suffix that appeared in some examples into the verb stem for *tlagaay*, changing the predicate to `_injure_v_rel` until it can be handled explicitly.

## Coverage

Overall coverage: 67.4%
Overgeneration: 20.7%

Our coverage as decreased since last lab primarily because of the addition of properties of Haida illustrated in our test suite that aren't accounted for in the starter grammar and matrix, especially the addition of several possessive examples. Some of the same sentences that did not parse in Lab 2, such as:

```
# 40 det with df suffix, plural
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {det}
hlaa 7aasgee srids ts’agts’agg qing7wagan
hlaa 7aasgee srid-s ts’agts’agg qing-7wa-gan
1SG.NOM these he.red-PST wagons see-PL-PST
`I saw these red wagons.'
```

still do not parse because we have yet to implement adjectives.

Also, while it appeared that the matrix customization was somewhat able to encode the bipartite negation features that we wanted (though it seems limited in how we can place the modifier), we were unable to get correct results, e.g.:

```
# 41 negation
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {neg}
gam gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qing.anggan
gam gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-.ang-gan
NEG horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-NEG-PST
`The horse did not see the wagon.'

# 42 negation
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {neg}
gyùudanee ts’agts’aggee qing.anggan
gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-.ang-gan
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-NEG-PST
`The horse did not see the wagon.'
```

Example 41 (grammatical) does not parse and example 42 (ungrammatical) does parse, exactly the opposite of what was expected. We will have to investigate further to understand why this might be happening and we will try to fix it in the tdl.

Our current level of overgeneration is due primarily to:

1. We still have "an overgeneration of word order because we do not yet have constraints to govern the SOV word order of common and proper nouns and the OSV word order of pronouns. This creates two versions of each sentence" (see lab 2 for examples)

2. Haida verbs don't require aspect, so simple tenses are underspecified for aspect, causing results with aspect markers. This is expected until we can edit the grammar.

  ```
  # 21 np optional det
  Source: author
  Vetted: f
  Judgment: g
  Phenomena: {det}
  gyùudan dladahldagan
  gyùudan dladahlda-gan
  horse fall.down-PST
  `A horse fell down.'  
  ```

3. pronoun drop is limited to low potency pronouns. However, the customization system doesn't allow you to add  an environment in which the rule applies. Until we edit the tdl, we are unable to prevent high potency pronouns from dropping, causing sentences with a dropped low pot object to produce readings with high potency.
