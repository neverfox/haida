1. The following phenomena are represented in the test suite and accounted for by the grammar matrix customization:

Coordination:

Haida has a polysyndeton coordination structure  which places a coordinating conjunction before each coordinand.
For nouns, there are two coordinating conjunctions: 7isgyaan and rahl. Enrico analyzes rahl as a left leaning 
clitic as shown in the following examples.

Enrico says that gyaan can not be used to coordinate NPs, as shown in #100, but he does highlight the following 
example:

#107 clausal coordination
Source: a:988
Vetted: s
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {crd}
Bill sguusiid taagangyaan sriwhan.isgyann tsii.nhan.isgyaan pickleshan.isan
Bill sguusiid taa-gan=gyaan sriw=han.is=gyaan tsii.n=han.is=gyaan pickles=han.isan
Bill potatoes eat-PST=and seaweed-too=and salmon-too=and pickles-too
`Bill eats potatoes (and) [he eats] seaweed (and) [he eats] salmon (and) [he eats] pickles.'

Enrico translates this bracketing the subject and verb to show that there may be a different process here than 
in #100. We have included the example because it is interesting, but it cannot be parsed in the current grammar.

To implement coordination, we created three strategies in the customization system. We created two polysyndeton 
strategies in which the conjunction occurs before a noun coordinand (one for each 7isgyaan and rahl). We treat rahl
as an independent word that attaches to the right of a noun syntactically but attached to the left of a noun
phonologically.  This strategy allows us to take advantage of the customization system, and say that it occurs before
the coordinand, but in our testsuite, we have written rahl up as clitic attached to the word before the coordinand.
Our third strategy specifies a polysyndeton conjunction, called gyaan, that comes before a VP or an S.

There is another coordination strategy in Haida which Enrico calls comitative coordination. A comitative clitic on the
last or all nouns changes the meaning of a sentence like "Bill and Mary fell down" from "Bill fell down and in a
separate event Mary also fell down" to "Bill and Mary fell down together as part of the same event." Distribution of
this clitic is shown below:

We have not implemented this phenomenon in grammar yet, as it will need to be done in tdl editing.

Attributive Adjectives

Attributive adjectives attach to the right of the constituent that they modify. However they are not predicative
and do not occur with a copula. They only modify noun phrases. Examples of this distribution are given below:

To implement the attributive adjectives, we added them to our lexicon in a single class that is strictly attributive, occurs
after the noun and impossibly behaves predicately.

Enrico claims that these attributive adjectives actually derive from verbs by way of a lexical rule. We elected to treat
them as adjectives nonetheless so that we could take advantage of the customization system. That said, for each "adjective"
that we entered into the lexicon, an intransitive verb exists that inflects for tense, etc. We have used these verbs
to demonstrate sentences that are similar to AP predicative sentences in other languages.

2. The following are properties of Haida that are illustrated in the test suite but not covered by the current state of
the grammar:

Matrix yes-no questions.

Yes/no questions in Haida are marked with a clitic after the first constituent. In addition, the head verb in a 
yes/no question lacks its position four and five suffixes. (I remind you that the Haida verb complex contains a number
of ordered suffixes, including negation, plural, modal, tense etc. tenses occcur in the fourth and fifth positions). 
As a result, a present tense question doesn't have a tense marker. The future tense marker is in the third suffix position, so
it is unaffected. But with the past tense marker omitted, yes/no questions in the past tense are marked with the 
evidential modal. Each of these tenses are represented in the data below.

It is worth noting that the following examples are ungrammatical, due either to the position of the clitic or the
presence of a position 3 or 4 (such as a past or present tense) suffix.

dii daagu gudang
dii 	daa-gu 	gudang
1SG.ACC	you-Q	understand
`Do you understand me?'

According to Enrico, the use of negation in a yes/no question is awkward and speakers of Haida offer alternatives,
rather than negation. For example, one would not say "Is Bill here yet? Did he not come?", but rather "Is Bill
here? Or is he still at home?"

The customization system does not handle second position clitics, so we will implement this structure in tdl.Roman 
attempted to add a feature for verbs to indicate whether or not they are evidential. However, due to a bug in the
customization system, this was not possible. However, to capture the past tense in yes/no questions, we will 
need to have the evidential working so we will correct this in the tdl. 

Matrix WH Questions

There are two question words for arguments in Haida: 'giisda' meaning who, given in the next examples and 'guus' 
meaning what, given in some examples below. There is no variation for subject/object. The primary method of 
expressing matrix wh-questions is with a focus-marked question word in the focus position at the start of the 
sentence.  For example:

#80 wh questions 
Source: a:134
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}
giisd.uu dang gyaa taanaa nee tla.awhlaang
giisd-.uu 	dang 	gyaa 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-ang
who-FOC		you	POSS	smokehouse	build-PRS
`Who is building your smokehouse?'

#81 wh questions

Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}

giisd-.uu 	dang 	gyaa 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-aa
who-FOC		you	POSS	smokehouse	build-EVID
`Who built your smokehouse?'

The following is ungrammatical because the question word is in the wrong position

#82 wh questions -- wrong order

Judgment: u
Phenomena: {wh}
dang gyaa giisd.uu taanaa nee tla.awhlaang
dang 	gyaa 	giisd-.uu 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-ang
you	POSS	who-FOC		smokehouse	build-PRS
`Who is building your smokehouse?'

This sentence is ungrammatical because there is no focus marker on the question word.

#83 wh questions

Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {wh}
giisd dang gyaa taanaa nee tla.awhlaang
giisd 	dang 	gyaa 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-ang
who	you	POSS	smokehouse	build-PRS
`Who is building your smokehouse?'

Although it is not discussed explicitly, the following example (used in the context of demonstrating anaphora
resolution) shows a question word that belongs in an embedded clause in the sentence focus position at the
beginning of the question:

#87 wh questions from embedded clause. adapted from 381
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}
giisd.uu dang gyaa taanaa nee tla.awhlaang Bill gudang-gang
giisd-.uu     dang     gyaa     taanaa nee     tla.awhla-ang    Bill    gudang-gang
who-FOC        you    POSS    smokehouse    build-PRS    Bill    thing-PRS
`Who Does Bill think is building your smokehouse?'

This example is meant to illustrate the position of the question word when the argument it represents is in
a lower clause. More information on embedded clauses is given in the embedded clause section below.

The second strategy for wh-questions allows the question word to occur in a non-focal position, but the 
interrogative clitic used for yes/no questions must mark the position where the question word belongs.

#84 wh questions
Source: a:134

Phenomena: {wh}
Bill guus taagaa huugu

We have not implemented either strategy for wh-questions as this topic is not covered in the customization
system.

Adverbs

Although Enrico does not describe adverbs in regards to the type of constituents they modify, he describes
their distribution in comparison to the negation adverb gam. The adverb (in some cases I consider
Enrico's manner adverbs to be temporal, but the distribution is not affected by this semantic distinction,
so I will just say adverb) can occur before or after the negation adverb, but its scope must be inside
the negation. Therefore, both of the following word orders are legal:

NEG	right.away	horse-DEF 	wagon-DEF 	injure-NEG-PST
`The horse did not damage the wagon right away.'

From the data Enrico gives to show this distribution, we can see that adverbs occur in three possible positions
to modify verbs, verb phrases and sentences. This permits the following sentences:

horse-DEF	wagon-DEF 	right.away	injure-PST
`The horse damaged the wagon right away.'

However, because Haida is a verb-final language, the following word order is impossible:

Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {adv}

horse-DEF	wagon-DEF 	injure-PST	right.away
`The horse damaged the wagon right away.'

Adverbs are not covered in the customization system, so we have not implemented them yet in our grammar.

Non-Verbal Predicates

Haida has a copula for non-verbal predicates of type NP and PP. It is important to note that the copula is NOT used
for attributive APs. Rather an intransitive verb exists for each adjective, as was previously discussed. The Haida
copula occurs in the standard verb position, after the subject and either NP or PP. The predicative phrase must occur
after its subject and before the copula. In the following examples, please keep in mind that while a mallard is necessarily
a bird, a bird is not necessarily a mallard, so we consider 109 to be ungrammatical because it places the predicative
NP before the subject.

We have not yet implemented non-verbal predicates because they are not on the menu for
this week. However, we did add a copula in the customization system that allows AP
complements. This implementation correctly prevents AP complements on the copula though
because we have already specified our adjectives as attributive only.

Embedded clauses
We have already seen that questions with embedded clauses are possible as shown below.

`Who Does Bill think is building your smokehouse?'

While this example contains a wh-word and is outside the scope of the assignment, it is valuable because it
is a relatively clear cut example. The examples and analysis that follow are drawn from Enrico's analysis of
anaphora resolution in embedded clauses. As a result, I am hesitant to over-generate negative examples, which
I do not know are ungrammatical with any certainty and we may have to make additional changes to our grammar
to implement these when we come to tdl editing.

With that disclaimer in mind, I have drawn the following generalizations about embedded clauses from the data.
Haida does not use a complementizer for embedded clauses and embedded clauses bear no overt marker. Instead, 
embedded clauses are a complement of the transitive verb and occur in object position. The content of the 
embedded clause follows standard Haida word order, including the fronting of question words as described above. 
Embedded questions do require the Q marker on the first argument as described in the section on yes/no 
questions.

I have selected the following examples from Enrico, based on their relative simplicity. Enrico provides a number of
sentences using think and say, which show that both verbs can be used in both declaratives and questions. It is 
also noteworthy that the verbs say and think require a non-factive marker on the verb in the embedded clause.

The data above demonstrates constituent ordering and the requirement of a question marker on embedded questions.
The optionality of the subject of the main clause is not explained, but may be the result of relative potency.
Enrico does not comment on the missing tense marker in example 151 either. We have not implemented embedded
clauses in this lab, but will do so in tdl editing. We have however, added the non-factive tense, which will be
required for implementation of embedded clauses for these verbs.

3. Coverage of our grammar over the testsuite.
Our coverage this week is 42.9%

This can be accounted for by the following:

This week we added a number of phenomena to our grammar that we do not expect to parse, as have been
outlined in section two above.

Negation
In last week's lab we discussed an error in the implementation of our negation rule. Further investigation
revealed that when the negative suffix is added to the verb, the NEG feature is saturated, so the verb does
not select for the required negative adverb. Emily has been sent the choices file and will recommend a tdl
edit. In the meantime the following parses but shouldn't:
# 42 negation

gyùudan-ee ts’agts’ag-gee qing-.ang-gan
horse-DEF wagon-DEF see-NEG-PST
`The horse did not see the wagon.'

Adjectives with tense
As discussed above, adjectives in Haida derive from verbs. However, in some cases, the adjective bears tense
that corresponds to the time at which the attribute is true/ relative.

Our overgeneration is only 5.8%. This is accounted for by the following.

We still have overgeneralization with word order in regards to potency, as discussed in lab 2. This causes
examples 11-13 to overgenerate.

One negation sentence also overgenerates per the negation bug mentioned above.

We do not have a way to implement tense on adjectives in the customization system, but will address this
in tdl editing.


4. Changes we made to our grammar to improve its performance (coverage and accuracy).

Added Tenses

In order to improve our testsuite with examples from the author, we have added two additional tenses: the
relative present and the evidential past (Enrico referres to the evidential past as a modal suffix, and it does
occur in the same suffix position as some modals).  For example:

# 74 yes/no questions
Source: a:132
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {q}
daagu gudangaa
daa-gu gudang-aa
you-Q understand-EVID
`Did you understand it?'

sguusiid-ee t’ijj ts’uudalaa-as ’laa daang-gan
potato-DF some.of be.small-PRS 3p throw.away-PST
`She threw away some of the small pototoes.'

When doing this Roman attempted to add a feature for verbs to indicate whether or not they are evidential.
However, due to a bug this was not possible and we will correct this in the tdl.

Corrected plural rule
Our plural rule was not correctly capturing the phenomenon in haida that causes a plural marker on the verb
if either argument is third person plural. To correct this, we added an incl-excl distinction to the grammar, even though
this distinction is not made in Haida, in order to implement a pernum feature in the customization system.
Using this pernum feature, we updated our plural morphology position to include a plural subject rule, a plural
object rule, a non-plural rule for transitive verbs and a separate for intransitives. These choices allow all
verbs to select for number, without a transitive singular noun being able to select one singular and one plural
object.
