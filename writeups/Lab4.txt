2. The following are properties of Haida that illustrated in the test suite but not covered by the current state of
the grammar

Matrix yes-no questions.

Yes/no questions in Haida are marked with clitic after the first constituent. In addition, the head verb in a 
yes/no question lacks it's position four and five suffixes (this is the suffix position for tense). As a result,
a present tense question doesn't have a tense marker. The future tense marker is in the third suffix position, so
it is unaffected. But with the past tense marker omitted, yes/no questions in the past tense are marked with the 
evidential modal. Each of these tenses are represented in the data below.

`Do you understand me?'

It is worth noting that the following examples are ungrammatical, due either to the position of the clitic or the
presence of a position 3 or 4 (such as a past or present tense) suffix.

According to Enrico, the use of negation in a yes/no question is awkward and speakers of Haida offer alternatives,
rather than negation. For example, one would not say "Is Bill here yet? Did he not come?", but rather "Is Bill
here? Or is he still at home?"

The customization system does not handle first position clitics, so we will impliment this structure in tdl. We 
also haven't added the evidential modal because evidentiality is not on the menu this quarter. However, to capture the 
past tense in yes/no questions, we will need to add it in the future. 

Matrix WH Questions

There are two question words for arguments in Haida: 'giisda' meaning who, given in the next examples and 'guus' 
meaning what, given in some examples below. There is no variation for subject/object. The primary method of 
expressing matrix wh-questions is with a focus-marked question word in the focus position at the start of the 
sentence.  For example:

#80 wh questions --a in awhla needs a a downward pitch accent
Source: a:134
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}
giisd.uu dang gyaa taanaa nee tla.awhlaang
giisd-.uu 	dang 	gyaa 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-ang
who-FOC		you	POSS	smokehouse	build-PRS
`Who is building your smokehouse?'

#81 wh questions --a in awhla needs a a downward pitch accent
Source: a:134
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}
giisd.uu dang gyaa taanaa nee tla.awhlayaa
giisd-.uu 	dang 	gyaa 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-aa
who-FOC		you	POSS	smokehouse	build-EVID
`Who built your smokehouse?'

The following is ungrammatical because the question word is in the wrong position

#82 wh questions -- wrong order a in awhla needs a a downward pitch accent
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {wh}
dang gyaa giisd.uu taanaa nee tla.awhlaang
dang 	gyaa 	giisd-.uu 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-ang
you	POSS	who-FOC		smokehouse	build-PRS
`Who is building your smokehouse?'

This sentence is ungrammatical because there is no focus marker on the question word.

#83 wh questions --a in awhla needs a a downward pitch accent
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {wh}
giisd dang gyaa taanaa nee tla.awhlaang
giisd 	dang 	gyaa 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-ang
who	you	POSS	smokehouse	build-PRS
`Who is building your smokehouse?'

Although it is not discussed explicitly, the following example (used in the context of demonstrating anaphora
resolution) shows a question word that belongs in an embedded clause in the sentence focus position at the
beginning of the question:

#87 wh questions from embedded clause. adapted from 381--a in awhla needs a a downward pitch accent
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}
giisd.uu dang gyaa taanaa nee tla.awhlaang Bill gudang-gang
giisd-.uu     dang     gyaa     taanaa nee     tla.awhla-ang    Bill    gudang-gang
who-FOC        you    POSS    smokehouse    build-PRS    Bill    thing-PRS
`Who Does Bill think is building your smokehouse?'

This example is meant to illustrate the position of the question word when the argument it represents is in
a lower clause. More information on embedded clauses is given in the embedded clause section below.

The second strategy for wh-questions allows the question word to occur in a non-focal position, but the 
interrogative clitic used for yes/no questions must mark the position where the question word belongs.

`What did Bill eat?'

We have not implemeted either strategy for wh-questions as this topic is not covered in teh customization
system.

Adverbs

Although Enrico does not describe adverbs in regards to the type of constituents they modify, he describes
their distribution in comparison to the negation adverb gam. The adverb (in some cases I consider
Enrico's manner adverbs to be temporal, but the distribution is not affected by this semantic distinction,
so I will just say adverb) can occur before or after the negation adverb, but it's scope must be inside
the negation. Therefore, both of the following word orders are legal:

right.away	NEG	horse-DEF 	wagon-DEF 	injure-NEG-PST
`The horse did not damage the wagon right away.'

NEG	right.away	horse-DEF 	wagon-DEF 	injure-NEG-PST
`The horse did not damage the wagon right away.'

From the data Enrico gives to show this distribution, we can see that adverbs occur in three possible positions
to modify verbs, verb phrases and sentences. Tihs permits the following sentences:

right.away	horse-DEF 	wagon-DEF 	injure-PST
`The horse damaged the wagon right away.'

horse-DEF	wagon-DEF 	right.away	injure-PST
`The horse damaged the wagon right away.'

However, because Haida is a verb-final language, the following word order is impossible:

Phenomena: {adv}

horse-DEF	wagon-DEF 	injure-PST	right.away
`The horse damaged the wagon right away.'






Embedded clauses
We have already seen that questions with embedded clauses are possible as shown below.

`Who Does Bill think is building your smokehouse?'

Adverbs are not covered in the customization system, so we have not implemented them yet in our grammar.

4. Changes we made to our grammar to improve its performance (coverage and accuracy).
