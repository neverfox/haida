1. The following phenomena are represented in the test suite and accounted for by the grammar matrix customization:

Coordination:

Haida has a polysyndeton coordination structure  which places a coordinating conjunction before each coordinand.
For nouns, there are two coordinating conjunctions: 7isgyaan and rahl. Enrico analyzes rahl as a left leaning 
clitic as shown in the following examples.

Enrico says that gyaan can not be used to coordinate NPs, as showen in #100, but he does highlight the following 
example:

#107 clausal coordination
Source: a:988
Vetted: s
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {crd}
Bill sguusiid taagangyaan sriwhan.isgyann tsii.nhan.isgyaan pickleshan.isan
Bill sguusiid taa-gan=gyaan sriw=han.is=gyaan tsii.n=han.is=gyaan pickles=han.isan
Bill potatoes eat-PST=and seaweed-too=and salmon-too=and pickles-too
`Bill eats potatoes (and) [he eats] seaweed (and) [he eats] salmon (and) [he eats] pickles.'

Enrico translates this bracketing the subject and verb to show that there may be a different process here than 
in #100. We have included the example because it is interesting, but it cannot be parsed in the current grammar.

To impliment coordination, we created three strategies in the customization system. We created two polysyndeton 
strategies in which the conjunction occurs before a noun coordinand (one for each 7isgyaan and rahl). We treat rahl
as an independent word that attaches to the right of a noun syntactically but attached to the left of a noun
phonologically.  This strategy allows us to take advantage of the customization system, and say that it occurs before
the coordinand, but in our testsuite, we have written rahl up as clitic attached to the word before the coordinand.
Our third stratecy specifies a polysyndeton conjunction, called gyaan, that comes before a VP or an S.

There is another coordination strategy in Haida which Enrico calls comative coordination. A comative clitic on the
last or all nouns changess the meaning of a sentence like "Bill and Mary fell down" from "Bill fell down and in a
separate event Mary also fell down" to "Bill and Mary fell down together as part of the same event." Distribution of
this clitic is shown below:

We have not implimented this phenomenon in grammar yet, as it will need to be done in tdl editing.

Attributive Adjectives

Attributive addjectives attache to the right of the constituent that they modify. However they are not predicative
and do not occur with a copula. They only modify noun phrases. Examples of this distribution are given below:

To impliment the attributive adjectives, we added them to our lexicon in a single class that is strictly attributive, occurs
after the noun and impossibly behaves predicately.

Enrico claims that these attributive adjectives actually derrive from verbs by way of a lexical rule. We elected to treat
them as adjectives non the less so that we could take advantage of the customization system. That said for each "adjective"
that we entered into the lexicon, an intrasitive verb exixts that infleccts for tense, etc. We have used these verbs
to demonstrate sentences that are similar to AP predicative sentences in other languages.

2. The following are properties of Haida that illustrated in the test suite but not covered by the current state of
the grammar

Matrix yes-no questions.

Yes/no questions in Haida are marked with clitic after the first constituent. In addition, the head verb in a 
yes/no question lacks it's position four and five suffixes (this is the suffix position for tense). As a result,
a present tense question doesn't have a tense marker. The future tense marker is in the third suffix position, so
it is unaffected. But with the past tense marker omitted, yes/no questions in the past tense are marked with the 
evidential modal. Each of these tenses are represented in the data below.

It is worth noting that the following examples are ungrammatical, due either to the position of the clitic or the
presence of a position 3 or 4 (such as a past or present tense) suffix.

Phenomena: {q}
dii daagu gudang
dii 	daa-gu 	gudang
1SG.ACC	you-Q	understand
`Do you understand me?'

According to Enrico, the use of negation in a yes/no question is awkward and speakers of Haida offer alternatives,
rather than negation. For example, one would not say "Is Bill here yet? Did he not come?", but rather "Is Bill
here? Or is he still at home?"

The customization system does not handle first position clitics, so we will impliment this structure in tdl. We 
also haven't added the evidential modal because evidentiality is not on the menu this quarter. However, to capture the 
past tense in yes/no questions, we will need to add it in the future. 

Matrix WH Questions

There are two question words for arguments in Haida: 'giisda' meaning who, given in the next examples and 'guus' 
meaning what, given in some examples below. There is no variation for subject/object. The primary method of 
expressing matrix wh-questions is with a focus-marked question word in the focus position at the start of the 
sentence.  For example:

#80 wh questions --a in awhla needs a a downward pitch accent
Source: a:134
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}
giisd.uu dang gyaa taanaa nee tla.awhlaang

`Who is building your smokehouse?'

#81 wh questions --a in awhla needs a a downward pitch accent

Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}

giisd-.uu 	dang 	gyaa 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-aa
who-FOC		you	POSS	smokehouse	build-EVID
`Who built your smokehouse?'

The following is ungrammatical because the question word is in the wrong position

#82 wh questions -- wrong order a in awhla needs a a downward pitch accent
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {wh}
dang gyaa giisd.uu taanaa nee tla.awhlaang
dang 	gyaa 	giisd-.uu 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-ang
you	POSS	who-FOC		smokehouse	build-PRS
`Who is building your smokehouse?'

This sentence is ungrammatical because there is no focus marker on the question word.

#83 wh questions --a in awhla needs a a downward pitch accent
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {wh}
giisd dang gyaa taanaa nee tla.awhlaang
giisd 	dang 	gyaa 	taanaa nee 	tla.awhla-ang
who	you	POSS	smokehouse	build-PRS
`Who is building your smokehouse?'

Although it is not discussed explicitly, the following example (used in the context of demonstrating anaphora
resolution) shows a question word that belongs in an embedded clause in the sentence focus position at the
beginning of the question:

#87 wh questions from embedded clause. adapted from 381--a in awhla needs a a downward pitch accent
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wh}
giisd.uu dang gyaa taanaa nee tla.awhlaang Bill gudang-gang
giisd-.uu     dang     gyaa     taanaa nee     tla.awhla-ang    Bill    gudang-gang
who-FOC        you    POSS    smokehouse    build-PRS    Bill    thing-PRS
`Who Does Bill think is building your smokehouse?'

This example is meant to illustrate the position of the question word when the argument it represents is in
a lower clause. More information on embedded clauses is given in the embedded clause section below.

The second strategy for wh-questions allows the question word to occur in a non-focal position, but the 
interrogative clitic used for yes/no questions must mark the position where the question word belongs.

#84 wh questions
Source: a:134

We have not implemeted either strategy for wh-questions as this topic is not covered in teh customization
system.

Adverbs

Although Enrico does not describe adverbs in regards to the type of constituents they modify, he describes
their distribution in comparison to the negation adverb gam. The adverb (in some cases I consider
Enrico's manner adverbs to be temporal, but the distribution is not affected by this semantic distinction,
so I will just say adverb) can occur before or after the negation adverb, but it's scope must be inside
the negation. Therefore, both of the following word orders are legal:

NEG	right.away	horse-DEF 	wagon-DEF 	injure-NEG-PST
`The horse did not damage the wagon right away.'

From the data Enrico gives to show this distribution, we can see that adverbs occur in three possible positions
to modify verbs, verb phrases and sentences. Tihs permits the following sentences:

`The horse damaged the wagon right away.'

However, because Haida is a verb-final language, the following word order is impossible:

Phenomena: {adv}

horse-DEF	wagon-DEF 	injure-PST	right.away
`The horse damaged the wagon right away.'

Non-Verbal Predicates

Haida has a copula for non-verbal predicates of type NP and PP. It is important to note that the copula is NOT used
for attributive APs. Rather an intransitive verb exists for each adjective, as was previously discussed. The Haida
copula occurs in the standard verb position, after the subject and either NP or PP. The predicative phrase must occur
after its subject and before the copula. In the following examples, please keep in mind that while a mallard is necessarily
a bird, a bird is not necessarily a mallard, so we consider 109 to be ungrammatical because it places the predicative
NP before the subject.
